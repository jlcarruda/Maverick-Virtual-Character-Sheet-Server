# Maverick
## The Virtual Character Sheet - Server
---
This will be a study repo for me, to put in practice some knowledge about DDD, Unit Testing and some tech.

### Goal
Besides the learning aspect, this project has the goal to make a tool that I will definately use.

I found that there's too many RPG Sheet apps for creation and management, but all of them are only frontend side and specific for one single system.
The idea behind Maverick is to be a tool that can help the passing of information about characters between Dungeon Master and Players, offering:
- A way to store all your RPG sheets, disregarding which system you play.
- A way for Dungeon Masters to interact in real time with your sheets and send private information to players.

This could grant not only velocity to the game, but to open up for new ways to play.
The great idea behind this project is to a platform that can be used not only to play IRL/Online RPG, but to be a new way to create interesting games as well.

### ROADMAP
This roadmap will be used as reference to all the steps to go. It's mutable, and could suffer updates withing each iteration
